The question came up on twitter: what use was that purple floweret on many Queen Anne's Lace (Wild Carrot, Dacaria carota) flowers?

So I dug into the literature, as only binohead can do, and found that Darwin himself had puzzled over this.

Others suggested it was for attracting pollinators somehow. The evidence is mixed at best; one study found insects sort of landed near it, but another didn't. A third study suggested it was a beetle mimic to deter parasitic beetles.

A nice project waiting for some undergrad to prove Darwin wrong.
